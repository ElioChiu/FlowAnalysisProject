# FlowAnalysisProject
The source of the project is from the design of the Spring 2023 semester course on Network Attack and Defense Technology at Beihang University. This project classifies and models the characteristics of network traffic by machine learning algorithms to enable the prediction of benign and malicious traffic. We employed logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and convolutional neural networks(CNN) in order to attain an accuracy rate of approximately 77%.
